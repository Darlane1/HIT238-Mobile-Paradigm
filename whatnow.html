    <h1>How to prevent it</h1>
    <p>The best way to protect yourself and others from this virus is by following the appropriate protocols. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Practicing good hygeine - eg. Washing hands correctly and thoroughly, using hand sanitizer.</li>
      <li>Practicing Social Distancing measures - staying 1.5m apart from others outside of your own household.</li>
      <li>Do not attend large public gatherings, or if necesszary and not within a known hotspot, practice social distancing.</li>
      <li>Self isolation - Isolating in ones own home, prevents contact with anyone who might be infected.</li>
      <li>Wherever may be considered appropriate, utilise protective equipment such as masks and gloves.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What does isolate in your home mean?</h3>
      <p>People who must isolate need to stay at home and must not attend public places, in particular
        work, school, childcare or university. Only people who usually live in the household should be in
        the home.
        Do not allow visitors into the home. Where possible, get others such as friends or family who are
        not required to be isolated to get food or other necessities for you. If you must leave the home,
        such as to seek medical care, wear a mask if you have one</p>
    <h3>Should I wear a face mask?</h3>
    <p>Both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the
      World Health Organization now recommend cloth masks for the general public,
      but earlier in the pandemic, both organizations recommended just the opposite.
      These shifting guidelines may have sowed confusion among the public
      about the utility of masks.<br>
    But health experts say the evidence is clear that masks can help prevent
    the spread of COVID-19 and that the more people wearing masks, the better.</p>
    <p>Remember to use a mask!</p>
