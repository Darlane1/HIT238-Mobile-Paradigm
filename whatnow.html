  <h1>How to prevent it</h1>
  <p>The best way to protect yourself and others from this virus is by following the appropriate protocols. This includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Practicing good hygeine - eg. Washing hands correctly and thoroughly, using hand sanitizer.</li>
    <li>Practicing Social Distancing measures - staying 1.5m apart from others outside of your own household.</li>
    <li>Do not attend large public gatherings, or if necessary and not within a known hotspot, practice social distancing.</li>
    <li>Self isolation - Isolating in ones own home, prevents contact with anyone who might be infected.</li>
    <li>Wherever may be considered appropriate, utilise protective equipment such as masks and gloves.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>What does isolate in your home mean?</h3>
    <p>People who must isolate need to stay at home and must not attend public places, in particular
      work, school, childcare or university. Only people who usually live in the household should be in
      the home.
      Do not allow visitors into the home. Where possible, get others such as friends or family who are
      not required to be isolated to get food or other necessities for you. If you must leave the home,
      such as to seek medical care, wear a mask if you have one</p>
  <h3>Should I wear a face mask?</h3>
  <p>The use of masks can help to prevent
      transmission of disease from infected patients to others, masks are not currently recommended
      for use by healthy members of the public for the prevention of infections like coronavirus.</p>
      <p>Remember to use a mask!</p>
