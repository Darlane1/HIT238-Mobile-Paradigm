  <h1>What is coronavirus?</h1>
    <p>Coronaviruses can make humans and animals sick. Some coronaviruses can cause illness
      similar to the common cold and others can cause more serious diseases, including Severe Acute
      Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). This new
      coronavirus originated in Hubei Province, China and the disease outbreak is named COVID-19.</p>

        <li>contact with droplets from an infected personâ€™s cough or sneeze</li>
        <li>touching objects or surfaces (like doorknobs or tables) that have droplets from an infected person, and then touching your mouth or face</li>
      </ul>
