  <h1>What is coronavirus?</h1>
    <p>Coronaviruses can make humans and animals sick. Some coronaviruses can cause illness
      similar to the common cold and others can cause more serious diseases, including Severe Acute
      Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). This new
      coronavirus originated in Hubei Province, China and the disease outbreak is named COVID-19.</p>

  <h3>How it spreads</h3>
    <p>COVID-19 can spread person to person through:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>close contact with an infectious person (including in the 48 hours before they had symptoms)</li>
        <li>contact with droplets from an infected personâ€™s cough or sneeze</li>
        <li>touching objects or surfaces (like doorknobs or tables) that have droplets from an infected person, and then touching your mouth or face</li>
      </ul>

  <h3>Symptoms</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Fever</li>
      <li>Coughing</li>
      <li>Shortness of breath</li>
      <li>Sore throat</li>
      <li>Loss of taste and smell</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>The facts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>COVID-19 is spread by being in close contact with someone who is already infected, or by coming into contact with cough/sneeze drops from an infected person. This includes any nasal fluid, or saliva that may be remaining on any surfaces/objects.</li>
