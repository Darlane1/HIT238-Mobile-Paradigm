  <hr class="my-4">
    <p class="text-justify">This new
    coronavirus originated in Hubei Province, China and the disease outbreak is named COVID-19.
    Coronaviruses can make humans and animals sick. Some coronaviruses can cause illness
      similar to the common cold and others can cause more serious diseases, including Severe Acute
      Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). </p>

  <h3 class="text-capitalize">How it spreads</h3>
    <p class="lead">COVID-19 can spread person to person through:</p>
      <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
        <li class="list-group-item">close contact with an infectious person (including in the 48 hours before they had symptoms)</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">contact with droplets from an infected personâ€™s cough or sneeze</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">touching objects or surfaces (like doorknobs or tables) that have droplets from an infected person, and then touching your mouth or face</li>
      </ul>

  <h3>Symptoms</h3>
  <p class="lead">It can take up to 14 days for symptoms to show after a person has been infected.</p>
    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
      <li class="list-group-item">Fever</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Coughing</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Shortness of breath</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Sore throat</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Loss of taste and smell</li>
    </ul>

  <h3 class="text-capitalize">The facts</h3>
    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
      <li class="list-group-item text-justify">Diseases can make anyone sick regardless of their race or ethnicity.
       Fear and anxiety about COVID-19 can cause people to avoid or reject others even though they are not at risk
       for spreading the virus.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item text-justify">You cannot catch COVID-19 from mosquitos. To date there has been no
          information or evidence to suggest that coronavirus (COVID-19) could be transmitted by mosquitoes.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item text-justify">Garlic will not prevent infections. Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties.
            However, there is no evidence that garlic has protected people from coronavirus (COVID-19).</li>
            <li class="list-group-item text-justify">People of ALL AGES can be infected by coronavirus (COVID-19).
              Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease)
              appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.</li>
